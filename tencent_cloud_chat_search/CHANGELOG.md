## 1.1.0

Introducing the first release of the brand new Tencent Cloud Chat UIKit.

Compared with the old version, this release brings several noteworthy enhancements:

1. **Theme Customization**: Switch between **light and dark mode** on the fly, or customize your own theme with our rich set of options.

2. **Internationalization**: We've added support for more languages including Arabic, and introduced **a Middle Eastern UI**. Our powerful and user-friendly [localization tools](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_cloud_chat_intl) make it easier than ever to [customize the localization configuration and the translation](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_cloud_chat_intl), and provide a localized user experience.

3. **Performance Enhancements**: We've made significant improvements to the **performance of the message list**, and introduced efficient and precise message positioning capabilities.

4. **Multimedia Support**: Experience improved multimedia and file message handling, with continuous playback for voice messages and **swipeable multimedia message previews**.

5. **Detail Optimizations**: We've added numerous detail optimizations including rich animations, haptic feedback, and refined interfaces to enhance the user experience.

6. **New Features**: Enjoy new features like a grid-style avatar, redesigned forwarding panel, group member selector, and a new message long-press menu.

7. **Modular Packages**: Components are broken down into **modular packages**, allowing for on-demand imports and reducing unnecessary bloat.
   Each modular package supports built-in navigation transitions. For instance, you can automatically navigate from a Conversation to a Message to start a chat,
   without the need to manually instantiate multiple pages and handle the transitions yourself. This greatly simplifies the complexity of development and integration.

8. **Developer-friendly Design**: We've introduced a more unified, standardized component parameter design, clearer code naming, and more detailed comments to make development easier and more efficient.

We're excited for you to try out our new Flutter Chat UIKit and look forward to seeing the amazing applications you'll create with it!
